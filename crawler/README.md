## Crawler Module
### Wally Magill, Febuary 2023

Inside this module is crawler.c  

Crawler is created off of the requirements, design, and implementation specified in LAB 4. This is part of the tiny search engine project and is the crawler module that is able to crawl webpages story the pages in files. There is also no assumptions that are made. For information on implementation look at crawler.c. To build the crawler use the command `$ make`. To test crawler run `$ make test &> testing.out` which will run a bash script writing to testing.out. To clean the subdirectory, `$ make clean`.
